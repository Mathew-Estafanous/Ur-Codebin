<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

Ur-Codebin is a website aimed at creating an easy to use code sharing platform, that allows users to quickly 
and efficiently share their code with others. This project is inspired by many other similar websites.

Most of the focus was not on front-end design, but more on the back-end.The main purpose of this project
was to help me learn more about back-end technologies,and the steps to creating a fully functioning 
production environment that uses many deployment technologies like Docker and AWS. 

### Future Features

This project is still a work in progress and there are many future changes that are expected to be added
to enhance the project. Here is a small list of features that are hoped to achieve.
* Public & Private Pastes
* More filtering options for public pastes
* Profile system that connects pastes to specific users.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
# Usage

The Ur-Codebin web application is very simple and easy to use. There are three main views that a user can interact with.
First one is the main +Paste View in which the user can paste a snippet of their code and choose certain options pertaining
to the paste. Once that is complete, the user can then click upload in which they will be re-routed to a page where they can
view their paste. This view as an individual link that can be shared with any other person they wish to share it with.

The final view, is the public pastes page. Users can sift through publicly available pastes and look into each of the pastes
and the information pertaining to them.
